# Spatial Analysis of Mobility Patterns

This repository contains an R Markdown document for the spatial analysis of mobility patterns. The analysis involves data processing, spatial visualization, and interpretation of spatiotemporal movement trends using R.

## 🗂 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to analyze mobility patterns across geographical spaces using spatial and spatiotemporal data. The document includes:

- Loading and preprocessing of mobility data
- Spatial joins and transformations
- Visualization of trajectories and movement densities
- Interpretation of mobility behavior over time and space

## 📁 File Structure

- `Spatial Analysis of Mobility Patterns.Rmd`: Main R Markdown file containing code, analysis, and visualizations.
- (Optional) `data/`: Folder for input datasets (not included here).
- (Optional) `output/`: Folder for output figures and reports.

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have the following R packages installed before running the `.Rmd` file:

```r
install.packages(c("sf", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "tmap", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
````

Some additional packages may also be required depending on the specifics of your dataset and visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `.Rmd` file in [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).
2. Knit the document to HTML, PDF, or Word.
3. Ensure any datasets or spatial files are placed in the correct paths or folders.

## 📊 Output

The output of this project is a dynamic report that includes:

* Maps and plots of mobility trajectories
* Summary statistics and time-based analysis
* Insights derived from spatial movement data

## 📌 Use Cases

This project can be useful for:

* Urban mobility research
* Transportation planning
* Geospatial data science education
* Smart city analytics
